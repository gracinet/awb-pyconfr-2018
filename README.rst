Slides for pycon.fr 2018
========================

This are slides of my presentation about Anyblok / WMS Base for the
pycon.fr 2018 conference (2018-10-06).

Of course, since pycon.fr is the annual gathering of the *french
speaking* Pythonistas, these are entirely written in french.

If you're looking for the revision actually projected at the event,
this was or will be the ``pycon.fr-2018`` tag.
